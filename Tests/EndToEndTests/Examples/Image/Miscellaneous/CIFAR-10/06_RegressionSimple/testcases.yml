testCases:
  CNTK Run must be completed:
    patterns:
      - __COMPLETED__

  Must train epochs in exactly same order and parameters:
    patterns:
      - Starting Epoch {{integer}}
      - learning rate per sample = {{float}}
      - momentum = {{float}}

  Epochs must be finished with expected results:
    patterns:
      - Finished Epoch
      - rmse = {{float,tolerance=0.5%}} * {{integer}}
      - totalSamplesSeen = {{integer}}
      - learningRatePerSample = {{float,tolerance=0.001%}}

  Final test results must match:
    patterns:
      - "Final Results: Minibatch[{{integer}}-{{integer}}]"
      - rmse = {{float,tolerance=0.5%}} * {{integer}}
